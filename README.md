<h2>About</h2>

Nightlight's main goal is to promote kindness on the internet. It is too easy to resort to condescending, rude or harmful comments behind the anonymity of being on the internet. This platform is designed for people wanting to help other people. We all deal with days of lower motivation, enthusiam or contentment. Helping someone through words has the chance to make a profound impact on mental health and well being.

<h3>Spread positivity and kindness.</h3>
The world could use more of it. We all need help sometimes whether it be words of kindness or just knowing that someone is there.

<h3>Make a difference with your words.</h3>
Send helpful, kind or motivational messages to brighten someone's day. Send messages anonymously if you don't want to draw too much attention to yourself.

<h3>Show love and appreciation.</h3>
Celebrate people who are trying to make a difference. Receiving love and appreciation shows the impact of your words.
